### Project Workflow

Number|Description
-----|-----------
**1**|Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
**2**|Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
**3**|Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
**4**|Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
**5**|Write a summary of your investigations.
**6**|Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

### SUMMARY ABOUT IRIS DATA SET

  This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set and this data will be used to write documentation and code using Python language.
  The Iris flower data set or as commonly known as Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher.

  The main raw data set used for this project was obtained from University of California's Machine Learning repository cited in the references below.  
  The data itself consists of 50 samples from 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
  From those samples, it was measured the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres, thus enabling Fisher to develop a linear discriminant model based on the combination of these four features to distinguish the species from each other.

Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines, and is considered one of the most known in the pattern recognition literature.

### HOW TO RUN THE CODE

First you will need to install an interpreter, such as Visual Studio Code, which was the one used for this project, where you can download at: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and all the necessary libraries used in this code, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, but to make it easier you may install the Anaconda package: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Secondly, download both the dataset file iris.csv and file project.py and open them in the same folder with your interpreter and run the code by typing: python project.py

### SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATIONS

#### Introduction to Analysis
* Before starting the analysis we had to import all the necessary libraries into python as described above, the next step was to actually import the dataset from the file iris.csv using pandas

* Once the dataset is fully readable by python, I thought it would be good to see some of the data, so I used a code (sample) for illustration on the actual dataset as seen here:

* Next I checked the total number of rows and columns on the data using the "shape" function

* Later I separated the 3 Classes of Iris to show how many samples had for each group as shown below:

#### Dataset Statistcal Analysis

* Moving to the statistical analysis first I started using numpy to check for the mean of each attribute, but later found out and I was able to use a code of pandas (describe) that could check the total count, means, standard deviations, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max. And this function is interesting, where we could visualize, for example that the sepal length goes from 4.3cm up to 7.9cm and with a mean of 5.84cm. You can have a look at the table here:
