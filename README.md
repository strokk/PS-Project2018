### Project Workflow

Number|Description
-----|-----------
**1**|Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
**2**|Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
**3**|Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
**4**|Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
**5**|Write a summary of your investigations.
**6**|Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.


## SUMMARY

  This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set and this data will be used to write documentation and code using Python language.
  The Iris flower data set or as commonly known as Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. The data itself consists of 50 samples from 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
  From those samples, it was measured the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres, thus enabling Fisher to develop a linear discriminant model based on the combination of these four features to distinguish the species from each other.
  To this point, this database is considered one of the most known in the pattern recognition literature.
