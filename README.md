### Project Workflow

Number|Description
-----|-----------
**1**|Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
**2**|Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.

### SUMMARY ABOUT IRIS DATA SET

  This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set and this data will be used to write documentation and code using Python language.
  The Iris flower data set or as commonly known as Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. [1]

  The main raw data set used for this project was obtained from University of California's Machine Learning repository cited in the references below. [2]
  The data itself consists of 50 samples from 3 classes (or species) of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
  From those 150 samples, it was measured the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres, thus enabling Fisher to develop a linear discriminant model based on the combination of these four attributes to distinguish the species from each other.

Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines, and is considered one of the most known in the pattern recognition literature.

### HOW TO RUN THE CODE

First you will need to install an interpreter, such as Visual Studio Code, which was the one used for this project, where you can download at: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and all the necessary libraries used in this code, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, but to make it easier you may install the Anaconda package: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Secondly, download both the dataset file iris.csv and file project.py and open them in the same folder with your interpreter and run the code by typing: python project.py

### SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATIONS

#### Introduction to Analysis
* Before starting the analysis we had to import all the necessary libraries into python as described above, the next step was to actually import the dataset from the file iris.csv using pandas

* Once the dataset is fully readable by python, I thought it would be good to see some of the data, so I used a code (sample) for illustration on the actual dataset as seen here:
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strokk/PS-Project2018/master/images/sample.PNG" width=500px></p><br><p align="center">Sample of Dataset</p>

* Next I checked the total number of rows and columns on the data using the "shape" function

* Later I separated the 3 Classes of Iris to show how many samples of data there is for each group of class as shown below:
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strokk/PS-Project2018/master/images/class.PNG" width=250px></p><br><p align="center">Class Distribution</p>

#### Dataset Statistcal Analysis

* Moving to the statistical analysis first I started using numpy to check for the mean of each attribute, but later found out that there is a pandas code (describe) that could check the total count, means, standard deviations, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max. And this function is interesting, where I could visualize, for example that the sepal length goes from 4.3cm up to 7.9cm and with a mean of 5.84cm. For more information the table is shown below:

#### Plots

* In this section the first plot I have used is the Histogram:
Just as a brief explanation, a histogram is a plot that shows the underlying frequency distribution (shape) of a dataset, thus allowing the inspection of the data for its underlying distribution, outliers, skewness, etc. [3]

First I used Matplotlib to generated a single histogram for each attribute separately, and those images can be found at the images folder, later I have made a single histogram containing all the 4 attributes for better demonstration as shown below:
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strokk/PS-Project2018/master/images/iris_histogram.png" width=500px></p><br><p align="center">Histogram of attributes</p>

* Next I have generated a Box and Whisker plot:
A box and whisker plot displays the variation in a set of data. This kind of plot can provide additional detail while allowing multiple sets of data to be displayed in the same graph. They summarize data from multiple sources and display the results in a single graph. Box and whisker plots allow for comparison of data from different categories for easier, more effective decision-making. A box and whisker plot is developed from five statistics, min value, second, quartile, median value, third quartile and max value. [4]

* Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed. The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval. For example, weight and height, weight would be on y axis and height would be on the x axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation [5]

First I used a function from pandas to generate the scatter plot, but later switched to a function from seaborn, where I generated one single image with various graphs containing all 4 attributes and their correlations, as demonstrated below:
